Common evaluation metrics for image classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions, while precision and recall focus on the model's performance for each class. If the model performs well on the test set, it indicates that it has learned meaningful patterns and can generalize to new data. However, if the model performs poorly on the test set, it may suggest issues like overfitting or biased data. -->
