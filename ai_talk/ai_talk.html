            <ul>
                <li>AI encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that traditionally
                    require human intelligence.</li>
                <li> <strong>Task-Specific AI:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed for specialized tasks, demonstrating intelligence in a narrow domain.</li>
                        <li>Image recognition, speech recognition, and game-playing AI are examples of task-specific AI.

                        <li>Systems that excel across a wide range of tasks, potentially surpassing human capabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>AGI could learn and adapt to new situations without explicit programming.</li>

                        <li>Tasks once considered uniquely human are now routinely performed by AI systems.</li>
                        <li>As AI capabilities expand, our understanding of what constitutes "true" intelligence also
                            shifts.</li>

                    being explicitly programmed.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Just like humans learn from experience, machine learning models
                    refine their accuracy as they process more data.</li>
                <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Machine learning models can identify patterns in data and apply
                    them to new, unseen situations, similar to how we use past experiences to navigate new challenges.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automating the learning process allows machine learning to tackle

            <ul>
                <li>What are Neural Networks?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain.</li>
                        <li>Consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do Neural Networks Learn?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Neurons receive inputs, process them, and pass outputs to the next layer</li>
                        <li>Connections between neurons have weights that determine the strength of the signal</li>
                        <li>Learning occurs by adjusting the weights to minimize prediction errors</li>

            <h2>A Concrete Example: Recognizing Cats and Dogs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Let's explore a practical application of neural networks: teaching a model to recognize images of
                    cats and dogs.</li>
                <li>This example will demonstrate the key steps involved in training a neural network for image
                    classification.</li>
                <li>By understanding this process, you'll gain insights into how AI systems learn from data and make
                    predictions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <div>
            <h2>Step 1: Collect and Label a Dataset</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The first step is to gather a dataset of cat and dog images and label each image accordingly.</li>
                <li>Labeling involves assigning the correct category ("cat" or "dog") to each image in the dataset.</li>
                <li>Key Point: The quality and diversity of the dataset are crucial for the model's performance. The
                    dataset should include various breeds, angles, and backgrounds to ensure the model learns robust
                    features.</li>

        <div>
            <h2>Step 2: Feed the Labeled Images into the Neural Network</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The labeled images are then fed into the neural network for training.</li>
                <li>The network processes the images and learns to extract relevant features that distinguish cats from
                    dogs.</li>
                <li>Key Point: The neural network automatically learns hierarchical features from the raw pixel data.
                    Lower layers capture simple features like edges and textures, while higher layers learn more complex
                    and abstract features specific to cats and dogs.</li>

    <div class="slide">
        <div>
            <h2>Step 3: Adjusting Weights to Minimize Prediction Errors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>During training, the network adjusts its internal weights to minimize the difference between
                    predicted and actual labels.</li>
                <li>It learns to associate certain features with cats and others with dogs based on the labeled
                    examples.</li>
                <li>Key Point: The learning process involves iteratively updating the weights through a technique called
                    backpropagation. By minimizing the prediction errors, the network gradually improves its ability to
                    classify cats and dogs accurately.</li>

    <div class="slide">
        <div>
            <h2>Step 4: Testing the Trained Network</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After training, the network is tested on new, unseen cat and dog images to evaluate its performance.
                </li>
                <li>The network uses its learned features to classify the new images as either cats or dogs.</li>
                <li>Key Point: Testing on unseen data helps assess the network's ability to generalize beyond the
                    training examples. A well-trained model should be able to accurately classify new images it hasn't
                    encountered before.</li>

                <li>Through this example, we've seen how a neural network can be trained to recognize cats and dogs in
                    images.</li>
                <li>The network learns from labeled examples, extracts relevant features, and adjusts its weights to
