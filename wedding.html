                    <p>We are happy to invite everyone to our (long awaited) wedding on June 1st, 2024.</p>

                    <p>Gavin and Shauna met in high school in grade 10 (2013). Was it long hours of marching band that brought them together? Probably, but their connection lasted well past their high school years and here they are now. They both share a collective interest in the outdoors, which lead to the perfect set up for Gavin's proposal at Lake O’Hara in December of 2022 (once again a massive thank you to Gavin's brother and sister-in-law Carson and Emmanuelle for skiing with them for photos).</p>

                    <p>We hope you can make it to our celebration, please fill out the Google form below so we have our numbers and we will see you on June 1st for an amazing ceremony and party</p>
