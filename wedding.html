                    <p>We are happy to invite you to the (long awaited) wedding of Gavin Guinn and Shauna Pelletier on June 1st, 2024.</p>

                    <p>Brought together in grade 10 (2013) by the long hours and close proximity required by the marching band program; we are now celebrating over 10 years together. Our shared interest in the outdoors set up Gavin's surprise proposal at Lake O'Hara in December 2022 (massive thanks to Carson and Emmanuelle for skiing in and taking photos).</p>

                    <p>Please fill out the form below to confirm your attendance, we will see you on June 1st for an our ceremony in Fish Creek Park and party at Skunkworks Distillery! </p>
